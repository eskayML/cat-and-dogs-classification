# cat-and-dogs-classification
A machine learning project for classifying images of cats and dogs
> It makes use of a dataset containing 25000 images of cats and dogs 

## STEPS  I TOOK BUILDING THE APPLICATION:
<hr>
- I built a model using transfer learning with the popular "Xception" model
<br>
- I then fitted the model to a larger portion of the data (training set). Note that I used a smaller portion for testing/validation 
<br>
- Checked the performance on the test data
<br>
- I deployed it on Streamlit

## HOW TO USE THE APP
```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

```
Install the dependencies using the command above and then run 

```console
$ streamlit run main.py

```
