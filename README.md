# cat-and-dogs-classification
A machine learning project for classifying images of cats and dogs
> Curated a dataset containing 25000 images of cats and dogs 

## STEPS  I TOOK BUILDING THE APPLICATION:
<hr>
- I built a model using convnets architecture and applied techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning 
<br>
- I then fitted the model to a larger portion of the data (training set). Note that I used a smaller portion for testing/validation 
<br>
- Checked the performance on the test data
<br>
- I built an app for the model using streamlit 

## HOW TO USE THE APP
```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

```
Install the dependencies using the command above and then run 

```console
$ streamlit run main.py

```
